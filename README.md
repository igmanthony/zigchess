# zigchess

This is a bare-bones move calculation program written in Zig. It draws heavy inspiration from a few Rust-based chess engines (mostly shakmaty and rustic). The "magic.zig", "setup.zig", and "attack.zig" files were mostly translations of the shakmaty project as I don't understand magic bitboards very well.

As such, this likely qualifies as a derivative work of shakmaty chess engine (Date 2/17/2021) and is licensed under the GPL3. I don't personally care for the GPL3 License, so if I'm understanding the GPL3 wrong, feel free to contact me to correct me and I'll license what I can it under the MIT.
